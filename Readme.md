Design Patterns
===============

Java implementation of the C++ samples from the book `Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software, Gamma et al., Addison-Wesley, 1996`.

The code is structured according to the `Design Pattern Catalog` from the book. There are packages for the three purposes `creational`, `structural` and `behavioral`. Each of these contain packages named as the pattern for which they contain samples.

Requirements
------------

* IntelliJ IDEA
* Java 1.8

Usage
-----

First of all you need the Design Patterns book. No explanation is added by me to the samples. To fully understand the patterns, please buy the book.

To execute the samples you need to run the tests. Each pattern package has it's own tests which may be used to see the pattern in action.

Contribution
------------

If you would like to honor me with investing time into this project simply check out the code, create a branch, do your changes, commit, push and create a pull request.

My only request is to please adhere to the general style of the code, that's all.
